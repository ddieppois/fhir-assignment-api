PHSA-FHIR-Assignment

Develop a small prototype POC application using Angular as the UI that launches in a browser (similar to a smart on fhir application) and requests FHIR data from a public FHIR server (any publicly accessible FHIR server). You can use Springboot in the backend as well if required.

 

Requirements: 

The app should pull a list of allergies for a patient from the FHIR server and then present that list of allergies.
The list should be editable (each field) as well the entire allergy should be able to be marked for removal if the user wishes to remove that allergy from this list.
A print button should allow this page to be printed.
 

Note: this app would not be used in production, it is a use case very similar to a project the candidate would be working on.
